# lion-msc
LaTeX class for B.Sc. and M.Sc. reports at Leiden Institute of Physics (LION).

The purpose of this class is twofold: It creates a uniform layout of the
student theses from our department. More importantly it contains several
fields on the front-page that the user needs to fill that are used in the
university administration (name, student number and name of supervisor)

Students are free to change the layout of the text but should leave the 
title page as it is.

The complete documentation is provided in lion-msc.pdf. 

The minimal.tex file is an empty template. 

The directory lion-msc contains the flat structure of the package as required by CTAN
The direcotory tds contains the additional format of the tex directory structure. This 
latter format should install the Leiden University logo in the right directory.
