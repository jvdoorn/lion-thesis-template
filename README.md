# Thesis template for BSc and MSc students at Leiden Institute of Physics (LION)
Originally created by [Michiel de Dood](https://github.com/mdedood/lion-msc), updated by me to be a bit more modern and to include a few more features. The refactored version of the template is based on what I found useful whilst writing my own theses. Below you can find an overview of important changes and features.

Contrary to the original design, this repository has been setup as a template repository instead of publishing the package to CTAN. This way, you can easily obtain the latest version of the tempalate without having to update your LaTeX distribution. To start writing your thesis press the [use this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=lion-thesis-template&template_owner=jvdoorn) button.
